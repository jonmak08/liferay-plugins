Notes/Design Changes


- Portlet-Topper Changes

 > I set it so that the portlet-topper would not display the title and would be (for the most part invisible),
   however if you are logged in as an admin with Edit Controls, then you will be able to still have the drag
   option at the top of the portlet and the menu still appears to configure the portlet. This seems to only
   work for half of the portlets. It appears to be that one the pages with images as backgrounds the portlet
   title does not appear. This was an issue that I placed as a lower priority to working on other things and
   I was not able to come back to completely fix this to where it would work on all the pages.


- Contact Page As Footer

 > I kept this page as a part of the footer in the normal theme structure becase it appears as though even the
   child pages (i.e. blog pages) have the contact portion at the bottom of them as well.

- Powered By Liferay Footer

 > I decided to place the 'Powered by Liferay' portion of the footer inside the Contact Us portion so that it
   blended in and had the same styling as it's context.

- Welcome Page Height Fix

 > One of the main problems I was trying to tackle was the fact that the main Welcome page, once loaded, would
   be given a height that was very small and not the normal full page. I tried to look for the script that was
   loading this styling but after many attempts could not find it. Apporaching the end of the time alloted to
   me for the exercise I decided to instead write a custom script to grab the current window height on load and
   set the welcome page's height to that height. I understand this is more of a band-aid than an actual fix, but
   with the time constraint this was what I deemed to be the best course of action.
