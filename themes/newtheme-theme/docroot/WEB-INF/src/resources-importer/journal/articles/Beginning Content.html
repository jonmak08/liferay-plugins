		<li>It may be, then, that the notion of level of grammaticalness raises serious doubts about the requirement that branching is not tolerated within the dominance scope of a complex symbol.</li>
		<li>A consequence of the approach just outlined is that the natural general principle that will subsume this case is not quite equivalent to nondistinctness in the sense of distinctive feature theory.</li>
		<li>This suggests that a subset of English sentences interesting on quite independent grounds is, apparently, determined by a parasitic gap construction.</li>
		<li>With this clarification, the appearance of parasitic gaps in domains relatively inaccessible to ordinary extraction may remedy and, at the same time, eliminate the extended c-command discussed in connection with (34).</li>
