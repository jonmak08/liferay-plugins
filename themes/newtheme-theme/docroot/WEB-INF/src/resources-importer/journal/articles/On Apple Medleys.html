<h2>On Apple Medleys</h2>
<br />

<p>Hello again, dear reader!</p>

<p>Today we will be journeying into the auspicious unknowns of apple clustering. Few are aware that apple clusters are actually dangerous gas hazards because apples themselves give off a surprising amount of ethylene gas which, if you are another sort of fruit, can cause you to decompose before your time! How very dangerous is that?! Bear that in mind as we examine a variety of these seemingly innocuous fruit-killers.</p>

<p>Here, as you can see, are red apples. They can be surprisingly hostile even to their own kind. The green apple on the right has been disincluded in the group and must become strong through the adversity. Apples can be very segregatory at times. Few people realize this, but next time you buy apples, try to find a different colored one in the bunch, you'll find that to be quite a challenge.<br />

<p>Here's an unsurprisingly unvaried cluster of juvenile apples. They're hanging about waiting for an unsuspecting fruit to come along. Often photographers will try to capture apples in such clusters with such lighting because there can seem to be a strange sense of ominous calm hovering in the air, similar to the still above a battle-field early in the morning.</p>

<p>Here's a defeated apple, revealing it's white interior. A well cheese-versed fellow can recognize the striking similarity between this apple and gouda cheese which also has a waxy protective exterior. Apples sometimes feign to be other forms of food in hopes that that an absent-minded human might be caught off guard while eating, but this rarely happens. By the process of evolution, humans are extremely adept at identifying apples for what they are.</p>

<p>Finally, there's a cluster of apples still on the tree. They've yet to be harvested and yet are already practicing their lethal tactics. The gas given off by apples while still on the tree is of little consequence as the wind often blows it away. This is also why insects find it so easy to find and bore into apples while they're still on the tree, the gas actually betrays apples while they're outside! Farmers will frequently bring apples in before they've finished ripening to give them a chance to develop unbugged (though at the risk of spoiling other fruit in the vicinity).</p>
