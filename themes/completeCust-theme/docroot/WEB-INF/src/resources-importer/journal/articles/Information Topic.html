<p>
	Here is some information and things like that. Do not attempt to make sense of this.

	To name the parent folder, the Plugins SDK automatically appended “-layouttpl” to your project name. A project can contain multiple layout templates. The directory structure is the same, but you’ll have a .png, .tpl, and .wap.tpl file for each layout template in the docroot/ folder. The “liferay-” files describe the layout templates for packaging and deployment.
